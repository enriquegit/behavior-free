</div>

<p>Exploratory data analysis (EDA) refers to the process of understanding your data. There are several available methods and tools for doing so, including summary statistics and visualizations. In this chapter, I will cover some of them. As mentioned in section <a href="intro.html#pipeline">1.4</a>, data exploration is one of the first steps of the data analysis pipeline. This step is important because it will help in the decision process during the next steps, for example, the selection of pre-processing tasks and predictive methods. Even though there already exist several EDA techniques, you are not constrained on them but you can always apply any means that you think will allow you to better understand your data and gain new insights.</p>
<div id="talking-with-field-experts" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Talking with Field Experts</h2>
<p>Sometimes we will be involved in the whole data analysis process starting with the idea, defining research questions, hypotheses, conducting the data collection, and so on. In those cases, it is easier to understand the initial structure of the data since you might had been the one responsible for designing the data collection protocol.</p>
<p>Unfortunately (or fortunately for some), it is often the case that we are already given a dataset. It may have some documentation or not. In those cases, it becomes important to talk with the field experts that designed the study and the data collection protocol to understand what was the purpose and motivation of each piece of data. Again, it is often not easy to be directly in touch with the people that conducted the initial study. One of the reasons may be that you found the dataset online and maybe the project is already over. In those cases, you can try to contact the authors. I have done that several times and they were very responsive. It is also a good idea to try to find experts in the field even if they were not involved in the project. This will allow you to understand things from their perspective and possibly to explain patterns/values that you may find later in the process.</p>
</div>
<div id="summary-statistics" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Summary Statistics</h2>
<p>Now that you understand how the data was collected and what is the meaning of each variable, it is time to find out how the actual data looks like. It is always a good idea to start looking at some summary statistics. This provides some general insights about the data and will help you in deciding future pre-processing steps. In R, an easy way to do this is with the <code>summary()</code> function. The following code reads the <em>SMARTPHONE ACTIVITIES</em> dataset and due to limited space, only prints a summary of the first <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> columns, column <span class="math inline">\(33\)</span>,<span class="math inline">\(35\)</span>, and the last one (the class).</p>

<p>For numerical variables, the output includes some summary statistics like the <em>min</em>, <em>max</em>, <em>mean</em>, etc. For factor variables, the output is different. It displays the unique values with their respective counts. If there are more than six unique values, the rest is omitted. For example, the <strong>class</strong> variable (the last one) has <span class="math inline">\(528\)</span> instances with the value <em>‘Downstairs’</em>. By looking at the <em>min</em> and <em>max</em> values of the numerical variables, one can see that those are not the same for all variables. For some variables, their maximum value is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, for others, it is less than <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and for some others, it is greater than <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. It seems that the variables are not in the same scale. This is important because some algorithms are sensitive to different scales. In chapters <a href="classification.html#classification">2</a> and <a href="ensemble.html#ensemble">3</a> we mainly used decision tree-based algorithms which are not sensitive to different scales, but some others like neural networks are. In chapter <a href="preprocessing.html#preprocessing">5</a>, a method to transform variables into the same scale will be introduced.</p>

<div class="rmdgoodpractice">
It is a good practice to check the <em>min</em> and <em>max</em> values of all variables to see if they have different ranges since some algorithms are sensitive to this.
</div>

<p>The output of the <code>summary()</code> function also shows some strange things. The statistics of variable <em>XAVG</em> are all <span class="math inline">\(0s\)</span>. Some other variables like <em>ZAVG</em> were encoded as characters. Seems that the <em>‘?’</em> symbol is appended to the numbers. In summary, the <code>summary()</code> function (I know, too many summaries in this sentence), allowed us to spot some errors in the dataset. What we do next with that information, will depend on the domain and application.</p>

<div id="class-distributions" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Class Distributions</h2>
<p>When it comes to behavior sensing, many of the problems are modeled as classification problems. This means that there are different possible categories. It is often a good idea to plot the class counts (class distribution). The following code shows how to do that for the <em>SMARTPHONE ACTIVITIES</em> dataset. First, the <code>table()</code> method is used to get the actual class counts. Then, the plot is generated with <code>ggplot</code>.</p>

<p>The most common activity turned out to be <em>‘Walking’</em> with <span class="math inline">\(2081\)</span> instances. It seems that the volunteers were a bit sporty since <em>‘Jogging’</em> is the second most frequent activity. One thing to note is that there are some big differences here. For example, <em>‘Walking’</em> v.s. <em>‘Standing’</em>. Those differences in class counts can have an impact when training classification models. This is because classifiers try to minimize the overall error regardless of the performance of individual classes, thus, they tend to prioritize the majority classes. This is called the <strong>class imbalance problem</strong>. This occurs when there are many instances of some classes but many fewer of some other classes. For some applications this can be a problem. For example, in fraud detection, datasets have many legitimate transactions but just a few of illegal transactions. This will bias a classifier to be good at detecting legitimate transactions but what we are really interested in is in detecting the illegal transactions. This is something very common to find in behavior sensing datasets. For example in the medical domain, it is much easier to collect data from healthy controls than from patients with a given condition. In chapter <a href="preprocessing.html#preprocessing">5</a>, some of the oversampling techniques that can be used to deal with the class imbalance problem will be presented.</p>

<div class="rmdgoodpractice">
When the classes are imbalanced, it is also recommended to validate the generalization performance using <em>stratified subsets</em>. This means that when dividing the dataset into train and test sets, the distribution of classes should be preserved. For example, if the dataset has class <em>‘A’</em> and <em>‘B’</em> and <span class="math inline">\(80\%\)</span> of the instances are of type <em>‘A’</em> then both, the train set and the test set should have <span class="math inline">\(80\%\)</span> of their instances of type <em>‘A’</em>. In cross-validation, this is known as <strong>stratified cross-validation</strong>.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> User-Class Sparsity Matrix</h2>
<p>In behavior sensing, usually two things are involved: <em>individuals</em> and <em>behaviors</em>. Individuals will express different behaviors to different extents. For the activity recognition example, some persons may go jogging frequently while others may never go jogging at all. Some behaviors will be present or absent depending on each individual. We can plot this information with what I call a <strong>user-class sparsity matrix</strong>. Figure <a href="edavis.html#fig:sparsityMatrix">4.2</a> shows this matrix for the activities dataset. The code to generate this plot is included in the script <code>EDA.R</code>.</p>

Figure 4.2: User-class sparsity matrix.

<p>The <em>x</em>-axis shows the user ids and the <em>y</em>-axis the classes. A colored entry (gray in this case) means that the corresponding user has at least one associated instance of the corresponding class. For example, user <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> performed all activities and thus, the dataset contains at least one instance for each of the six activities. On the other hand, user <span class="math inline">\(25\)</span> only has instances for two activities. Users are sorted in descending order (users that have more classes are at the left). At the bottom of the plot, the sparsity is shown (<span class="math inline">\(0.18\)</span>). This is just the percentage of empty cells in the matrix. When all users have at least one instance of every class the sparsity is <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. When the sparsity is different than <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, one needs to decide what to do depending on the application. The following cases are possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Some users did not perform all activities. If the classifier was trained with, for example, <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> classes and a user never goes <em>‘jogging’</em>, the classifier may still sometimes predict <em>‘jogging’</em> even if a particular user never does that. This can degrade the predictions’ performance for that particular user and can be worse if that user never performs other activities of the possible <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span>. A possible solution is to train different classifiers with different class subsets. If you know that some users never go <em>‘jogging’</em> then you train a classifier that excludes <em>‘jogging’</em> and use that one for that set of users. The disadvantage of this is that there are many possible combinations so you need to train many models. Since several classifiers can generate prediction scores and/or probabilities per class, another solution would be to train a single model with all classes and predict the most probable class excluding those that are not part of a particular user.</p></li>
<li><p>Some users can have unique classes. For example, suppose there is a new user that has an activity labeled as <em>‘Eating’</em> which no one else has, and thus, it was not included during training. In this situation, the classifier will never predict <em>‘Eating’</em> since it was not trained for that activity. One solution could be to add the new user’s data with the new labels and retrain the model. But if not too many users have the activity <em>‘Eating’</em> then, in the worst case, they will die of starvation. In a less severe case, the overall system performance can degrade because as the number of classes increases it becomes more difficult to find separation boundaries between categories, thus, the models become less accurate. Another possible solution is to build <strong>user-dependent</strong> models for each user. These, and other types of models in <strong>multi-user settings</strong> will be covered in chapter <a href="multiuser.html#multiuser">9</a>.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Boxplots</h2>
<p>Box plots are a good way to visualize the relationship between variables and classes. R already has the <code>boxplot()</code> function. In the <em>SMARTPHONE ACTIVITIES</em> dataset, the <em>RESULTANT</em> variable represents the ‘total amount of movement’ considering the three axes. It is the average of the square roots of the sum of the values of each axis squared √(xi^2 + yi^2 + zi^2). The following code displays a set of boxplots (one for each class) with respect to the <em>RESULTANT</em> variable.</p>

With boxplots we can inspect one feature at a time. If you want to visualize the relationship between predictors, correlation plots can be used instead. Correlation plots will be presented in the next subsection.</p>

<div id="correlation-plots" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.6</span> Correlation Plots</h2>
<p>This type of plot allows us to look at relationships between pairs of variables. The most common type of relationship is the <strong>Pearson correlation</strong>. The Pearson correlation measures the degree of <strong>linear</strong> association between two variables. It takes values between <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. A correlation of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> means that as one of the variables increases, the other one does too. A value of <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> means that as one of the variables increases, the other decreases. A value of <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> means that there is no association between the variables. Figure <a href="edavis.html#fig:pearsonExamples">4.4</a> shows several examples of correlation values. Note that the correlations of the examples at the bottom are all <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>s. Even though there are some noticeable patterns in some of the examples, their correlation is <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> because those relationships are not linear.</p>

<p>The Pearson correlation (denoted by <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>) between two variables <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> can be calculated as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:pearsoncorr">\[\begin{equation}
  r = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y}) }{ \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\bar{y})^2}}
  \tag{4.1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The following code snippet uses the <code>corrplot</code> library to generate a correlation plot for the <em>HOME TASKS</em> dataset. Remember that this dataset contains two sets of features. One set extracted from audio and the other one extracted from the accelerometer sensor. First, the Pearson correlation between each pair of variables is computed with the <code>cor()</code> function and then the <code>corrplot()</code> function is used to generate the actual plot. Here, we specify that we only want to display the upper diagonal with <code>type = "upper"</code>. The <code>tl.pos</code> argument controls where to print the labels. In this example, at the top and in the diagonal. Setting <code>diag = FALSE</code> instructs the function not to print the principal diagonal which is all ones since it is the correlation between each variable and itself.</p>

<p>It looks like the correlations between sound features (v1_) and acceleration features (v2_) are not too big. In this case, this is good since we want both sources of information to be as independent as possible such that they capture different characteristics and can complement each other as explained in section <a href="ensemble.html#multiviewhometasks">3.4</a>. On the other hand, there are high correlations between some acceleration features. For example <em>v2_maxY</em> with <em>v2_sdMagnitude</em>.</p>

Please, be aware that the Pearson correlation only captures linear relationships.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.6.1</span> Interactive Correlation Plots</h3>
<p>When plotting correlation plots, it is useful to also visualize the actual correlation values. When there are many variables, it becomes difficult to do that. One way to overcome this limitation is by using interactive plots. The following code snippet uses the function <code>iplotCorr()</code> from the <code>qtlcharts</code> package to generate an interactive correlation plot. The nice thing about it, is that you can actually inspect the cell values by hovering the mouse. If you click on a cell, the corresponding scatter plot is also rendered. This makes these types of plots very convenient tools to explore variable relationships.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.7</span> Timeseries</h2>
<p>Behavior is something that usually depends on time. Thus, being able to visualize time series data becomes essential. To illustrate how timeseries data can be plotted, I will use the <code>ggplot</code> package and the <em>HAND GESTURES</em> dataset. Recall that the data was collected with a tri-axial accelerometer, thus, for each hand gesture we have <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-dimensional timeseries. Each dimension represents one of the <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em> axes. First, we read one of the text files that stores a hand gesture from user <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Each column represents an axis. Then, we need to do some formatting. We will create a data frame with three columns. The first one is a timestep represented as integers from <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to the number of points per axis. The second column is a factor that represents the axis <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, or <em>z</em>. The last column contains the actual values.</p>

<p>Note that the last column (<em>values</em>) contains the values of all axes instead of having one column per axis. Then we can use the <code>ggplot()</code> function. The lines are colored by type of axis and this is specified with <code>colour = type</code>. The <code>type</code> column should be a factor. The line type is also dependent on the type of axis and is specified with <code>linetype = type</code>.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is useful to be able to interactively zoom, highlight, select, etc. parts of the plot. In R, there is a package called <code>dygraphs</code> <span class="citation">(Vanderkam et al. <a href="#ref-dygraphs" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> that allows you to generate fancy interactive plots for timeseries data. The following code snippet reads a hand gesture file and ads a column at the beginning called <code>timestep</code>.</p>

<p>In the online version of this book or if you run the code, you can zoom in by clicking and dragging over a region. A double click will restore the zoom. It is possible to add a lot of customization to the plots. For example, the following code adds a text title, fills the area under the lines, adds a point of interest line, and shades the region between <span class="math inline">\(30\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(40\)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.8</span> Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)</h2>
<p>In many situations, our data is comprised of several variables. If the number of variables is more than <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-dimensional data), it becomes difficult to plot the relationships between data points. Take, for example, the <em>HOME TASKS</em> dataset which has <span class="math inline">\(27\)</span> predictor variables from accelerometer and sound. One thing that we may want to do is to visually inspect the data points and check whether or not points from the same class are closer compared to points from different classes. This can give you an idea of the difficulty of the problem at hand. If points of the same class are very close and grouped together then, it is likely that a classification model will not have trouble separating the data points. But how do we plot such relationships with high dimensional data? One method is by using multidimensional scaling (MDS) which consists of a set of techniques aimed at reducing the dimensionality of data so it can be visualized in <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>D or <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>D. The objective is to plot the data such that the original distances between pairs of points are preserved in a given lower dimension <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>.</p>
<p>There exist several MDS methods but most of them take a distance matrix as input (for example, Euclidean distance). In R, generating a distance matrix from a set of points is easy. As an example, let’s generate some sample data points.</p>

<p>The <code>dist()</code> function can be used to compute the distance matrix. By default, this function computes the Euclidean distance between rows:</p>

<p>The output is the Euclidean distance between the pairs of rows <span class="math inline">\((1,2)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((1,3)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((2,3)\)</span>.</p>
<p>One way to obtain cartesian coordinates in a <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> dimensional space for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> points from their distance matrix <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is to use an iterative algorithm <span class="citation">(Borg, Groenen, and Mair <a href="#ref-borg2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>. Such an algorithm consists of the following general steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Initialize <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> data points with random coordinates <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> of dimension <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>.</li>
<li>Compute a distance matrix <span class="math inline">\(D&#39;\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</li>
<li>Move the coordinates <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> such that the distances of <span class="math inline">\(D&#39;\)</span> get closer to the original ones in <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>.</li>
<li>Repeat from step <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> until the error between <span class="math inline">\(D&#39;\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> cannot be reduced any further or until some predefined max number of iterations.</li>
</ol>
<p>The script <code>iterative_mds.R</code> implements this algorithm (<code>iterativeMDS()</code> function) which is based on the implementation from <span class="citation">(Segaran <a href="#ref-segaran2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span>. Its first argument <code>D</code> is a distance matrix, the second argument <code>maxit</code> is the total number of iterations and the last argument <code>lr</code> controls how fast the points are moved in each iteration. The script also shows how to apply the method to the <em>eurodist</em> dataset which consists of distances between several European cities. Figure <a href="edavis.html#fig:mds0">4.7</a> shows the initial random coordinates of the cities. Then, Figure <a href="edavis.html#fig:mds30">4.8</a> shows the result after <span class="math inline">\(30\)</span> iterations. Finally, Figure <a href="edavis.html#fig:mdsFinal">4.9</a> shows the final result. By only knowing the distance matrix, the algorithm was able to find a visual mapping that closely resembles the real positions.</p>

Before continuing, I would like to apologize because the previous example (cities’ distances) has nothing to do with <em>behavior</em> which is supposed to be the topic of this book (and probably the reason you are reading it).

<p>R already has more efficient implementations to perform MDS and one of them is via the function <code>cmdscale()</code>. Its first argument is a distance matrix and the second argument <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the target dimension. It also has some other additional parameters that can be tuned. This function implements classical MDS based on <span class="citation">Gower (<a href="#ref-gower1966" role="doc-biblioref">1966</a>)</span>. The following code snippet uses the <em>HOME TASKS</em> dataset. It selects the accelerometer-based features (v2_*), uses the <code>cmdscale()</code> function to reduce them into <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, dimensions and plots the result.</p>

<p>From those plots, it can be seen that the different points are more or less grouped together based on the type of activity. Still, there are several points with no clear grouping which would make them difficult to classify. In section <a href="ensemble.html#multiviewhometasks">3.4</a> from chapter <a href="ensemble.html#ensemble">3</a>, we achieved a classification accuracy of <span class="math inline">\(0.85\)</span> when using only the accelerometer data.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.9</span> Heatmaps</h2>
<p>Heatmaps are a good way to visualize the ‘intensity’ of events. For example, a heatmap can be used to depict website interactions by overlapping colored pixels relative to the number of clicks. This visualization eases the process of identifying the most relevant sections of the given website, for example. In this section, we will generate a heatmap of weekly motor activity levels of individuals with and without diagnosed depression. The <em>DEPRESJON</em> dataset will be used for this task. It contains motor activity recordings captured with an actigraphy device which is like a watch but has several sensors including accelerometers. The device registers the amount of movement every minute. The data contains recordings of <span class="math inline">\(23\)</span> patients and <span class="math inline">\(32\)</span> controls (those without depression). The participants wore the device for <span class="math inline">\(13\)</span> days on average.</p>
<p>The accompanying script <code>auxiliary_eda.R</code> has the function <code>computeActivityHour()</code> that returns a matrix with the average activity level of the depressed patients or the controls (those without depression). The matrix dimension is <span class="math inline">\(24\times7\)</span> and it stores the average activity level at each day and hour. The <code>type</code> argument is used to specify if we want to compute this matrix for the depressed or control participants.</p>

<p>Since we want to compare the heatmaps of both groups we will normalize the matrices such that the values are between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> in both cases. The script also contains a method <code>normalizeMatrices()</code> to do the normalization.</p>

<p>All in all, heatmaps provide a good way to look at the overall patterns of a dataset and can provide some insights to further explore some aspects of the data.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.10</span> Automated EDA</h2>
<p>Most of the time, doing an EDA involves more or less the same steps: print summary statistics, generate boxplots, visualize variable distributions, look for missing values, etc. If your data is stored as a data frame, all those tasks require almost the same code for any dataset. To speed up this process, some packages have been developed. They provide convenient functions to explore the data and generate automatic reports.</p>
<p>The <code>DataExplorer</code> package <span class="citation">(Cui <a href="#ref-dataexplorer" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> has several interesting functions to explore a dataset. The following code uses the <code>plot_str()</code> function to plot the structure of <code>dataset</code> which is a data frame read from the <em>HOME TASKS</em> dataset. The complete code is available in script <em>EDA.R</em>. The output is shown in figure <a href="edavis.html#fig:dfStructure">4.11</a>. This plot shows the number of observations, the number of variables, the variable names and their types.</p>

<p>Another useful function is <code>introduce()</code>. This one prints some statistics like the number of rows, columns, missing values, etc. Table <a href="edavis.html#tab:introduceCmd">4.1</a> shows the output result.</p>

<p>The package provides more functions to explore your data. The <code>create_report()</code> function can be used to automatically call several of those functions and generate a report in html. The package also offers functions to do feature engineering such as replacing missing values, create dummy variables (covered in chapter <a href="preprocessing.html#preprocessing">5</a>), etc. For a more detailed presentation of the package’s capabilities please check its vignette<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>
<p>There is anohter similar package called <code>inspectdf</code> <span class="citation">(Rushworth <a href="#ref-inspectdf" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> which has similar functionality. It also offers some functions to check if the categorical variables are imbalanced. This is handy if one of the categorical variables is the response variable (the one we want to predict) since having imbalanced classes may pose some problems (more on this in chapter <a href="preprocessing.html#preprocessing">5</a>). The following code generates a plot that represents the counts of categorical variables. This dataset only has one categorical variable: <em>label</em>.</p>

<p>Here, we can see that the most frequent class is <em>‘eat_chips’</em> and the less frequent one is <em>‘sweep’</em>. We can confirm this by printing the actual counts:</p>

This chapter provided a brief introduction to some exploratory data analysis tools and methods however, this is only a tiny subset.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.11</span> Summary</h2>
<p>One of the first tasks during a data analysis pipeline is to familiarize yourself with the data. There are several techniques and tools that can provide support during this process.</p>
<ul>
<li>Talking with field experts can help you to better understand the data.</li>
<li>Generating summary statistics is a good way to gain general insights of a dataset. In R, the <code>summary()</code> function will compute such statistics.</li>
<li>For classification problems, one of the first steps is to check the distribution of classes.</li>
<li>In multi-user settings, generating a <strong>user-class sparsity matrix</strong> can be useful to detect missing classes per user.</li>
<li><strong>Boxplots</strong> and <strong>correlation plots</strong> are used to understand the behavior of the variables.</li>
<li>R, has several packages for creating interactive plots such as <code>dygraphs</code> for timeseries and <code>qtlcharts</code> for correlation plots.</li>
<li><strong>Multidimensional scaling (MDS)</strong> can be used to project high-dimensional data into <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> dimensions so they can be plotted.</li>
<li>R has some packages like <code>DataExplorer</code> that provide some degree of automation for exploring a dataset.</li>
</ul>
